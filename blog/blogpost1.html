    <p>It may be overwhelming when you first walk into a jewellery store with all the diamonds sparkling back at you, but developing a basic understanding is quite easy. Refer to the <a href="../jewellerybasics/diamonds.html">guide on our webpage</a> to get you up to speed for the rest of this article. </p>
    <p>Now you know the basics, you may ask yourself which of the four C’s more important when picking a diamond. Well some are easy to eliminate, I would say a diamond’s cut is the most important as people generally have their own preference to shape and there’s not much to deliberate over. Carat, clarity, color are the more difficult properties to decide as there are trade-offs depending on budget.</p>
    <p><em>Carat</em></p>
    <p>Is there a specific minimum size desired? If not, move on to clarity and color first the come back to carat. If there is however, there may be limitations on what clarity and color combinations are possible.
    </p>
    <p><em>Clarity</em></p>
    <p>How much of an impact are inclusions visible by the naked eye? If they are important, clarity will need to be a minimum of VS2 or if you’re lucky, well placed inclusions on a SI1. Keep in mind that even if it doesn’t matter that some inclusions can be seen by the naked eye, the more there are, the greater of an impact it will have on the sparkle of the diamond.</p>
    <p><em>Color</em></p>
    <p>How much of a yellow tint is acceptable? It is difficult to distinguish the colors at the top of the spectrum (D-F) without comparing them to each other. Also, it is more tolerable if you are mounting the diamond onto a yellow gold band, so the overall contrast is less. These are some considerations to keep in mind when choosing diamond color.</p>
    <p>Truthfully, the carat, clarity and color are very dependent on what the tolerances and budget is of the individual purchasing the diamond and there is no most important factor. Some people want a larger diamond, some want a flawless one and others want a white one. It ultimately boils down to the which properties are more important and can be forgone for the others.</p>
