            Diamond Certifcations - Which one is more reputable?
        </figcaption>

    <p>Some diamonds have certifications which list out their properties as determined by the respective institutions gemologists. Two major diamond testing laboratories which you may see certificates from are GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and EGL (European Gemological Institute). EGL has two completely separate entities, EGL International and EGL USA.</p>
    <p>These laboratories will provide reports stating what they perceive to be the diamond’s properties, but the important thing to keep in mind is that the properties states between the testing labs are not comparable. GIA is more popular and strict with their gradings, resulting in lower diamond properties which are generally more realistic. EGL will commonly provide higher diamond properties, particularly EGL International. </p>
    <p>If desired, these laboratories will also laser inscribe a certification number to the diamond which their report is linked to. This links the diamond to the report so what you’re paying for is what you’re actually getting. The reports are also available online for anyone to access from their websites, so you can go have a look at the reports yourself on <a href="https://www.gia.edu/report-check-landing" target="_blank">GIA</a>, <a href="https://www.eglusa.com/verify-a-report/" target="_blank">EGL USA</a> or <a href="http://egl-platinum.com/laboratory/grading/verification/" target="_blank">EGL International</a>.</p>
    <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that each laboratory will have different consistency when grading the same diamond. Generally speaking, GIA grades their diamonds more consistency than EGL, making reports more comparable when deciding between which diamond to purchase.</p>
    <p>The end result of these different testing laboratory reports is a diamond with a moderately priced GIA report, or that same diamond that’s considered a bargain with a EGL report. It is really up to you, the buyer, to educate yourself before purchasing as there is minimal regulations in place for these reports.</p>
